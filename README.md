# Testing Branch 
This branch exists to contain the demo code, the final code as well as some useful testing files that we used along the way that are described below

## motorturn.py 
This is a simple python script that turns the motors both direction and waits while displaying what should be happening to the user.

## Cal.py 
This is the old version of the code that uses the ics library to turn motors. This idea was scrapped after finding the ephem library, realizing the code wouldn't work after the year, and it would difficult for other use since the calendar only contained the sunrise and sunset times for dubuque iowa.

## .ics files
These calendars are contain the sunrise and sunset times for Dubque, IA and should work for most places in the midwest. 

## buttonpress.py 
This little piece of code display's a dark message to the user when it is pressed. This code will come in handy for the limit switches that prevent the motors from turning too far.
